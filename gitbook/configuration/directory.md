## oidc-agent Directory
An oidc-agent directory will be created when using oidc-gen for the first time. 
Depending on the existence of `~/.config` it will be located at one of these
locations:
- `~/.config/oidc-agent`
- `~/.oidc-agent`

Alternatively the location can also be set through an environment variable
called `OIDC_CONF_DIR`. However, we note that this environment variable has
to be present whenever you use one of the `oidc-` binaries. It is therefore
recommend to set it in the `.bash_profile` or similar. 
See also [`oidc-keychain`](../oidc-keychain/oidc-keychain.md).

All account configuration generated by `oidc-gen` are saved in this
oidc-agent directory. Additionally there is a config file named `issuer.config`. This file can be used to specify a list of issuers (one issuer per line) that are used as suggestions by `oidc-gen`. `oidc-gen` will also update this issuer list after an account configuration was created successfully. oidc-agent installs a similar file under `/etc/oidc-agent`, however, that file should not be edited by the user, but it might be updated with new oidc-agent versions.
