Description: Commandline tool for obtaining OpenID Connect Access tokens on the commandline
 This tool consists of five programs:
   - oidc-agent that handles communication with the OIDC provider
   - oidc-gen that generates config files
   - oidc-add that loads (and unloads) configuration into the agent
   - oidc-token that can be used to get access token on the command line
   - oidc-keychain that re-uses oidc-agent across logins
